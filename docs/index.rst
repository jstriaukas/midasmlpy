The ``midasmlpy`` module is a Python implementation of the ``midasml`` approach - providing estimation and prediction methods for high-dimensional mixed-frequency time-series data.
It implements the estimation and prediction methods for high-dimensional mixed-frequency (MIDAS) time-series and panel data used in regression models.
The regularized MIDAS models are estimated using orthogonal (e.g. Legendre) polynomials and the sparse-group LASSO estimator.
The package is equipped with the fast implementation of the sparse-group LASSO estimator by means of proximal block coordinate descent.
High-dimensional mixed frequency time-series data can also be easily manipulated with functions provided in the package.
